            Low---by necessity turning breadwinner---started what eventually
            became a multi-million dollar public relations and grant writing

            In 1979 Lisa Low enrolled in the M.F.A. program at the University of

            managing its publication----with maximum attention. Her poems have
            appeared in, been accepted at, or are forthcoming from The Potomac
